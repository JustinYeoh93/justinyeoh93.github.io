# Introduction
There is a small group of supporters of the streamer [Hitohira Hana](http://hitohira-hana.com/) that came together to develop random tools to support her stream.

This is one those tools and its sole goal to act as the support for [Nightbot](https://nightbot.tv/) in our [discord](https://discord.gg/kEwSAa9D) server. 

# Courtesy 
This could not have been achievable without the work done on the open source [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

# TLDR
GitHub repository found here: [ohana-discord-bot](https://github.com/ohanagirl/ohana-discord-bot)

# Features
List of features we hope to add with this bot.
